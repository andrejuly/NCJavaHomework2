1. Write a program that reads an integer and prints it in binary, octal, and
hexadecimal. Print the reciprocal as a hexadecimal floating-point number.
2. Write a program that reads an integer angle (which may be positive or
negative) and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. Try
it first with the % operator, then with floorMod.
3. Using only the conditional operator, write a program that reads three
integers and prints the largest. Repeat with Math.max.
4. Write a program that prints the smallest and largest positive double values.
Hint: Look up Math.nextUp in the Java API.
6. Write a program that prints the smallest and largest positive double values.
Hint: Look up Math.nextUp in the Java API.
13. Write a program that prints a lottery combination, picking six distinct
numbers between 1 and 49. To pick six distinct numbers, start with an
array list filled with 1...49. Pick a random index and remove the element.
Repeat six times. Print the result in sorted order.
